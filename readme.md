# SZTU_WebCoruse_2024  

## Description  

The internet is all about creating anxiety, but in reality, it's not that serious at all. I have a regular second tier university, one year of experience, and have met three companies in Beijing. I have received four offers, with the highest being 32k and the lowest being 27k. 32k is outsourcing, and there is also a 30k self-developed project that I can consider. Not to mention, I have two interviews tomorrow, every year in winter and winter, and every year I work in computer science. As a result, my computer salary is not easy to earn over 20000 yuan per month, Guys. Some say that if I don't learn HTML+CSS+JS now, I won't have the opportunity in the future. Taking advantage of the current dividends, I will 'ferocious' make a lot of moneyðŸ˜‹.
